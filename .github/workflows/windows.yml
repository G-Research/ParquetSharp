    # This is where GitHub actions on Windows get really nonsensical.
    # MSBuild is not on the path by default, despite this running on a Windows / Visual Studio 2019 docker image.
    # We currently use 3rd party action to avoid hard coding the path to MSBuild.
    # Comedy bonus: GitHub is now owned by Microsoft.
