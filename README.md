## Introduction

ParquetSharp is a cross-platform .NET library for reading and writing Apache [Parquet][1] files.

It is implemented in C# as a [PInvoke][2] wrapper around [Apache Parquet C++][3] to provide high performance and compatibility. Check out [ParquetSharp.DataFrame][4] if you need a convenient integration with the .NET [DataFrames][5].

## Quickstart

The following examples show how to write and then read a Parquet file with three columns representing a timeseries of object-value pairs.
These use the low-level API, which is the recommended API and closely maps to the API of Apache Parquet C++.

Writing a Parquet File:

```csharp
var timestamps = new DateTime[] { /* ... */ };
var objectIds = new int[] { /* ... */ };
var values = new float[] { /* ... */ };

var columns = new Column[]
{
    new Column<DateTime>("Timestamp"),
    new Column<int>("ObjectId"),
    new Column<float>("Value")
};

using var file = new ParquetFileWriter("float_timeseries.parquet", columns);
using var rowGroup = file.AppendRowGroup();

using (var timestampWriter = rowGroup.NextColumn().LogicalWriter<DateTime>())
{
    timestampWriter.WriteBatch(timestamps);
}
using (var objectIdWriter = rowGroup.NextColumn().LogicalWriter<int>())
{
    objectIdWriter.WriteBatch(objectIds);
}
using (var valueWriter = rowGroup.NextColumn().LogicalWriter<float>())
{
    valueWriter.WriteBatch(values);
}

file.Close();
```

Reading the file back:

```csharp
using var file = new ParquetFileReader("float_timeseries.parquet");

for (int rowGroup = 0; rowGroup < file.FileMetaData.NumRowGroups; ++rowGroup) {
    using var rowGroupReader = file.RowGroup(rowGroup);
    var groupNumRows = checked((int) rowGroupReader.MetaData.NumRows);

    var groupTimestamps = rowGroupReader.Column(0).LogicalReader<DateTime>().ReadAll(groupNumRows);
    var groupObjectIds = rowGroupReader.Column(1).LogicalReader<int>().ReadAll(groupNumRows);
    var groupValues = rowGroupReader.Column(2).LogicalReader<float>().ReadAll(groupNumRows);
}

file.Close();
```

## Documentation

For more detailed information on how to use ParquetSharp, see the following documentation:

* [Writing parquet files](docs/Writing.md)
* [Reading parquet files](docs/Reading.md)
* [Working with nested data](docs/Nested.md)
* [Row-oriented API](docs/RowOriented.md) &mdash; a higher level API that abstracts away the column-oriented nature of Parquet files
* [Custom types](docs/TypeFactories.md) &mdash; how to override the mapping between .NET and Parquet types
* [Use from PowerShell](docs/PowerShell.md)

## Rationale

We desired a Parquet implementation with the following properties:
- Cross platform (originally Windows and Linux - but now also macOS).
- Callable from .NET Core.
- Good performance.
- Well maintained.
- Close to official Parquet reference implementations.

Not finding an existing solution meeting these requirements, we decided to implement a .NET wrapper around apache-parquet-cpp (now part of Apache Arrow) starting at version 1.4.0. The library tries to stick closely to the existing C++ API, although it does provide higher level APIs to facilitate its usage from .NET. The user should always be able to access the lower-level API.

## Performance

The following benchmarks can be reproduced by running `ParquetSharp.Benchmark.csproj`. The relative performance of ParquetSharp 10.0.1 is compared to [Parquet.NET](https://github.com/aloneguid/parquet-dotnet) 4.6.2, an alternative open-source .NET library that is fully managed. The Decimal tests focus purely on handling the C# `decimal` type, while the TimeSeries tests benchmark three columns of the types `{int, DateTime, float}`. Results are from a Ryzen 5900X on Linux 6.2.7 using the dotnet 6.0.14 runtime.

If performance is a concern for you, we recommend benchmarking your own workloads and testing different encodings and compression methods. For example, disabling dictionary encoding for floating point columns can often significantly improve performance.

|              | Decimal (Read) | Decimal (Write) | TimeSeries (Read) | TimeSeries (Write) |
| -----------: | :------------: | :-------------: | :---------------: | :----------------: |
| Parquet.NET  | 1.0x           | 1.0x            | 1.0x              | 1.0x               |
| ParquetSharp | 4.0x Faster    | 3.0x Faster     | 2.8x Faster       | 1.5x Faster        |

## Known Limitations

Because this library is a thin wrapper around the Parquet C++ library, misuse can cause native memory access violations.

Typically this can arise when attempting to access an instance whose owner has been disposed. Because some objects and properties are exposed by Parquet C++ via regular pointers (instead of consistently using `std::shared_ptr`), dereferencing these after the owner class instance has been destructed will lead to an invalid pointer access.

As only 64-bit runtimes are available, ParquetSharp cannot be referenced by a 32-bit project.  For example, using the library from F# Interactive requires running `fsiAnyCpu.exe` rather than `fsi.exe`.

In the 5.0.X versions, reading nested structures was introduced. However, nesting information about nulls is lost when reading columns with Repetition Level optional inside structs with Repetition Level optional. ParquetSharp does not yet provide information about whether the column or the enclosing struct is null.

## Building

Building ParquetSharp for Windows requires the following dependencies:
- Visual Studio 2022 (17.0 or higher)
- Apache Arrow (10.0.1)

For building Arrow (including Parquet) and its dependencies, we recommend using Microsoft's [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).
The build scripts will use an existing vcpkg installation if either of the `VCPKG_INSTALLATION_ROOT` or `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variables are defined,
otherwise vcpkg will be downloaded into the build directory.
Note that the Windows build needs to be done in a Visual Studio Developer PowerShell for the build script to succeed.

**Windows (Visual Studio 2022 Win64 solution)**
```
> build_windows.ps1
> dotnet build csharp.test --configuration=Release
```
**Linux and macOS (Makefile)**
```
> ./build_unix.sh
> dotnet build csharp.test --configuration=Release
```

We have had to write our own `FindPackage` macros for most of the dependencies to get us going - it clearly needs more love and attention and is likely to be redundant with some vcpkg helper tools.
