## Rationale

We desired a Parquet implementation with the following properties:
- Cross platform (originally Windows and Linux - but now also macOS).
- Callable from .NET Core.
- Good performance.
- Well maintained.
- Close to official Parquet reference implementations.

Not finding an existing solution meeting these requirements, we decided to implement a .NET wrapper around apache-parquet-cpp (now part of Apache Arrow) starting at version 1.4.0. The library tries to stick closely to the existing C++ API, although it does provide higher level APIs to facilitate its usage from .NET. The user should always be able to access the lower-level API.
